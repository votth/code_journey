sort1 uses: bubble sort

How do you know?: I answered this last, didn't have a concrete way of distinguish this from the other two sorting algos, although it was decently fast when running with the reverseved50000.txt

sort2 uses: merge sort

How do you know?: took the least time to sort the reverseved txts, since this has the best average/worst case sorting time

sort3 uses: selection sort

How do you know?: took the longest time to run through the sorted50000.txt, since the selection sort has the worst 'best case' among these 3
